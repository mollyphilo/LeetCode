# 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an array  `nums`  of  _n_  integers and an integer  `target`, find three integers in  `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

**Constraints:**

-   `3 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
-   `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
-   `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

**Solution:**

For every index i in the array, keep 2 pointers for low and high and find their best values such that diff of their sum and target is smallest. Time complexity is O(N^2) and space complexity is O(1)

```go
import "sort"

func threeSumClosest(nums []int, target int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    if n < 3 { return 0 }
    sort.Ints(nums)
    diff := 3001
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        low,high := i+1,n-1
        for low < high {
            sum := nums[i] + nums[low] + nums[high]
            if abs(target - sum) < abs(diff) {
                diff = target - sum
            }else if sum < target {
                low++
            }else {
                high--
            }
        }
    }
    
    return target - diff
}

func abs(x int) int {
    if x > 0 { return x }
    return -x
}
```
