# 882.  Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph

You are given an undirected graph (the  **"original graph"**) with  `n`  nodes labeled from  `0`  to  `n - 1`. You decide to  **subdivide**  each edge in the graph into a chain of nodes, with the number of new nodes varying between each edge.

The graph is given as a 2D array of  `edges`  where  `edges[i] = [ui, vi, cnti]`  indicates that there is an edge between nodes  `ui`  and  `vi`  in the original graph, and  `cnti`  is the total number of new nodes that you will  **subdivide**  the edge into. Note that  `cnti  == 0`  means you will not subdivide the edge.

To  **subdivide**  the edge  `[ui, vi]`, replace it with  `(cnti  + 1)`  new edges and  `cnti`  new nodes. The new nodes are  `x1`,  `x2`, ...,  `xcnti`, and the new edges are  `[ui, x1]`,  `[x1, x2]`,  `[x2, x3]`, ...,  `[xcnti+1, xcnti]`,  `[xcnti, vi]`.

In this  **new graph**, you want to know how many nodes are  **reachable**  from the node  `0`, where a node is  **reachable**  if the distance is  `maxMoves`  or less.

Given the original graph and  `maxMoves`, return  _the number of nodes that are  **reachable**  from node_ `0` _in the new graph_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/08/01/origfinal.png)

	Input: edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], maxMoves = 6, n = 3
	Output: 13
	Explanation: The edge subdivisions are shown in the image above.
	The nodes that are reachable are highlighted in yellow.

**Example 2:**

	Input: edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], maxMoves = 10, n = 4
	Output: 23

**Example 3:**

	Input: edges = [[1,2,4],[1,4,5],[1,3,1],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]], maxMoves = 17, n = 5
	Output: 1
	Explanation: Node 0 is disconnected from the rest of the graph, so only node 0 is reachable.

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 104)`
-   `edges[i].length == 3`
-   `0 <= ui  < vi  < n`
-   There are  **no multiple edges**  in the graph.
-   `0 <= cnti  <= 104`
-   `0 <= maxMoves <= 109`
-   `1 <= n <= 3000`

**Solution:**

-   Time Complexity:  O(E log N), where  E  is the length of  `edges`.
    
-   Space Complexity:  O(E)
 
```go
/*
Dijkstra is used to find shortest paths from one node to all other nodes

This problem adds a constraint of number of max moves can take from that node, which means we'll enqueue only nodes within max moves

This is undirected graph, therefore we could count duplicated nodes. #nodes on an edge is the limit of nodes can be reached from either end
