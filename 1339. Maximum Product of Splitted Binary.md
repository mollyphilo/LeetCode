# 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree

Given the  `root`  of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

Return  _the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees_. Since the answer may be too large, return it  **modulo**  `109  + 7`.

**Note**  that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/21/sample_1_1699.png)

	Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
	Output: 110
	Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/21/sample_2_1699.png)

	Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
	Output: 90
	Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)

**Example 3:**

	Input: root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]
	Output: 1025

**Example 4:**

	Input: root = [1,1]
	Output: 1

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[2, 5 * 104]`.
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 104`

**Solution:**

```go
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Left *TreeNode
 *     Right *TreeNode
 * }
 */
func maxProduct(root *TreeNode) int {
  var product,sum int
  // 2 calls to first calculate the sum then update the product
  sum = max_product(root, &product,&sum)
  sum = max_product(root, &product,&sum)
  return product % (int(1e9) + 7)
}

func max_product(root *TreeNode, product *int, sum *int) int {
  if root == nil { return 0 }
  
  subsum := root.Val + max_product(root.Left, product, sum) + max_product(root.Right, product, sum)
  *product = max(*product, subsum*(*sum - subsum))
  return subsum
}

func max(a,b int) int {
  if a > b { return a }
  return b
}
```
