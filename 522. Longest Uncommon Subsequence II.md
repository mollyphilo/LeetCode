# 522.  Longest Uncommon Subsequence II

Given an array of strings  `strs`, return  _the length of the  **longest uncommon subsequence**  between them_. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return  `-1`.

An  **uncommon subsequence**  between an array of strings is a string that is a  **subsequence of one string but not the others**.

A  **subsequence**  of a string  `s`  is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from  `s`.

-   For example,  `"abc"`  is a subsequence of  `"aebdc"`  because you can delete the underlined characters in  `"aebdc"`  to get  `"abc"`. Other subsequences of  `"aebdc"`  include  `"aebdc"`,  `"aeb"`, and  `""`  (empty string).

**Example 1:**

	Input: strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"]
	Output: 3

**Example 2:**

	Input: strs = ["aaa","aaa","aa"]
	Output: -1

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= strs.length <= 50`
-   `1 <= strs[i].length <= 10`
-   `strs[i]`  consists of lowercase English letters.

**Solution:**

From GraceMeng:

> A string is always the subsequence of itself.  
And it can not be subsequence of strings that shorter than itself.  
So LUS will always be one of ths strings in the list.  
e.g. ["ab", "abc"] will return 3 for "abc" is not the subsequence of "ab".  
["ab", "abc", "abcd"] will return 4 for "abcd" is not the subsequence of "ab" or "abc".  
So for each string in list, we check if it is the subsequence of the others.  
If it is not the subsequence of the others, it is the candidate answer.  
We get the overall longest one and return the length of it.

Time Complexity: O(N^2 x M^2) , N = len(strs), M = max str length. Space Complexity: O(1)
```go
func findLUSlength(strs []string) int {
  var ans,j int = -1,0
  n := len(strs)
  
  for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
    for j = 0; j < n; j++ {
      if i != j && isSub(strs[i],strs[j]) {
        break
      }
    }
    if j == n && ans < len(strs[i]) {
      ans = len(strs[i]) 
    }
  }
  
  return ans
}

// check if s1 is sequence to s2
func isSub(s1,s2 string) bool {
  var i int
  for j := 0; j < len(s2) && i < len(s1); j++ {
    if s2[j] == s1[i] {
      i++
    }
  }
  
  return i == len(s1)
}
