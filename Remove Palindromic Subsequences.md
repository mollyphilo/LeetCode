# Remove Palindromic Subsequences
Given a string  `s`  consisting only of letters  `'a'`  and  `'b'`. In a single step you can remove one palindromic  **subsequence**  from  `s`.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ababa"
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** String is already palindrome

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abb"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** "**a**bb" -> "**bb**" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "baabb"
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** "**baa**b**b**" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
-   `s[i]`  is either  `'a'`  or  `'b'`.

**Solution:**

If the string is palindromic, it takes one step to make string empty
If string is not palindromic, and because there are only two characters, it takes 2 steps, one to remove all 'a', the other is to remove all 'b'

```go
func removePalindromeSub(s string) int {
    n := len(s)
    i,j := 0,n-1
    for i < n && j >= 0 {
        if s[i] != s[j] {
            return 2
        }
        i++
        j--
    }
    return 1
}
```
