# Sorting algorithms

All major programming languages have a built in method for sorting. It is usually correct to assume and say sorting costs O(nâ‹…logn), where n is the number of elements being sorted. For completeness, here is a chart that lists many common sorting algorithms and their completeness. The algorithm implemented by a programming language varies; for example, Python uses Timsort but in C++, the specific algorithm is not mandated and varies.

> Definition of a stable sort from Wikipedia: "Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e. values). That is, a sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key and with R appearing before S in the original list, R will appear before S in the sorted list."
